# AADC
Code for the Speed Controller and OpenCV Camera of the AADC car

This was a project done by 5 students from the University of Bologna: Sarim Mehdi, Giacomo Bartoli, Tong Liu, Vincenzo Lomonaco and Francesco Sovrano. Our idea was to teach the car to drive autonomously using a reinforcement learning approach where the car would be provided a spline to follow and also avoid any obstacles in its way.
